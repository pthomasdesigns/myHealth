myHealth app is a first take on providing access to health information for consumers. In this initial version it fetches data from an ReST server running on AWS (Amazon Web Services) and displays to the user.
The ReST Server is built using Java, Spring framework, Hibernate ORM (Object Relational Mapping) and mySQL database. It serves the API requests from the app by fetching data from a mySQL database.
